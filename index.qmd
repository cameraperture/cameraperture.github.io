Welcome! I'm Charlotte Imbert, an M.S. Statistics student at Stanford University. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience with a minor in Mathematics at Pomona College.

I build practical machine learning and analytics that turn high-dimensional data into decisions. I'm especially excited about technical roles in tech and biotech, where scalable systems and human-centered products meet.

With IBM at the Wimbledon Championships (2022 & 2023), I analyzed tennis points in real-time and helped create the live stats millions of fans saw and engaged with. That pace taught me precision under pressure, rigorous attention to detail, and clear communication with operations teams. This experience motivated the tennis statistical analyses that can be found on my website.

After 18 years of competitive tennis and a career-ending nerve injury, I pivoted from playing to understanding health, performance, and recovery. At Stanford's Systems Neuroscience & Pain Lab, I had the opportunity to build predictive ML models on clinical datasets. This involved wrangling messy data, rigorous validation, and translating findings for pain clinicians.

What sets my work apart is my focus on statistical soundness and real-world applicability. I pay close attention to model interpretability, not just accuracy. I choose models suitable for the problemâ€™s structure, validate out of sample, and explain uncertainty in plain language so clinicians and product teams can act with the right level of confidence. I build end-to-end in Python and R, and I'm proficient in SQL, MATLAB, and Excel. My neuroscience research experience has made me especially sensitive to the importance of quality data and thorough experimental design (garbage in, garbage out!).

I'm fluent in four languages (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and love collaborative teams. This site is my portfolio. If you're in big tech or biotech and exploring data/ML work, I'd love to connect.

(Actively seeking Summer 2026 data science/PM internships.)

In my spare time, you can find me playing pickleball tournaments, hiking in the California nature, performing stand-up comedy, playing trivia, or hanging out with friends.
