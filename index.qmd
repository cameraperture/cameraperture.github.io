Welcome! My name is Charlotte Imbert and I'm an undergraduate student at Pomona College. I am majoring in Neuroscience with a minor in Math. I love Statistics and ML and am currently working on a research project aiming to predict cognitive function from neuroimaging (fMRI) data.

When I'm not studying or doing research, I love to play pickleball and perform stand-up comedy. Additionally, I love Daft Punk, Taylor Swift, cheese, and visiting National Parks. I am a French and British dual citizen, and I speak fluent French, Spanish and Portuguese.
