Welcome! My name is Charlotte Imbert and I'm a senior at Pomona College with a background in neuroscience, mathematics, and statistics. I love using machine learning to uncover patterns in high-dimensional data, whether in health technology, sports analytics, or other fields. George Box once said, 'All models are wrong, but some are useful.' It is this lack of a single correct answer, combined with its applicability to every field, that makes data science a powerful tool and a passion I want to dedicate my career to.

As a Data Entry Statistician for IBM at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in 2022 and 2023, I analyzed and categorized tennis points in real-time. My observations were compiled into match statistics reports for players and coaches, and were displayed on sports live-scoring websites reaching millions of fans. This was my first introduction to the power of data in improving performance. This experience motivated the tennis statistical analyses that can be found on my website.

I was a competitive tennis player for many years, eventually playing at the collegiate level, but had to step away from the sport due to chronic nerve pain. This experience pushed me to understand pain on a deeper level and shaped my decision to major in neuroscience. My research internship at Stanford's Systems Neuroscience and Pain Lab fueled this interest further, and I had the opportunity to apply predictive machine learning models to clinical data.

Now, I’m especially interested in how data science can help us better understand and treat chronic pain. With experience in neuroscience labs and a strong foundation in statistics and machine learning, I want to apply these skills to bridge the gap between research and real-world solutions, using data to drive better pain management and more personalized care.

This site serves as a portfolio of my work, where I showcase data science projects and statistical analyses. If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!
